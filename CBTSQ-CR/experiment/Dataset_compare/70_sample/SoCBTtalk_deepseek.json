For example, could they have assumed you wouldn’t enjoy a burger place, rather than judging you?  \n\nAlso, if a friend told you they weren’t invited to a meat-heavy meal because they were vegetarian, what would you say to them? Sometimes we’re kinder to others than we are to ourselves.  \n\nHow do you think holding this belief (“they see me as useless”) affects your mood or interactions with them?
