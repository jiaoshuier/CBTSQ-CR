It's beautiful how you're separating her behavior from your value, and noticing that her difficulty with art conversations might mirror her general struggle with emotional expression. The perspective you've reached—that this isn't about you—is incredibly healthy.  \n\nTo build on this, you might prepare for that \"That's nice, honey\" response by deciding beforehand what would feel like a meaningful interaction to you. Maybe share why a particular piece matters to you, or ask if she'd like you to explain your technique. But also remember—as you wisely noticed—that her limited response doesn't reflect your talent or worth. Keep creating art that fulfills you, and consider seeking out others who can truly appreciate it. You're developing such compassionate understanding—both of your mother and yourself.",

The balanced perspective you’ve reached (\"It *could* be bad, but there are quieter, likelier explanations\") is a real victory. Try gently reinforcing this over the next few days: when the catastrophic thought pops up, pause and name one alternative (like the silent retreat example), then notice how each version feels in your body. The goal isn’t to force optimism, just to stretch that muscle of flexibility. You’re building a new habit, and every small effort counts. I’m really hopeful for you!",

Let me ask: When you’ve expressed your dislike to your wife, how does she typically respond? And have there been times when she *has* adjusted meals to accommodate you? (This might help uncover whether her actions reflect a pattern or a one-time oversight.)  \n\nAlso, I’m curious: If a close friend told you they felt this strongly about an ingredient their partner kept using, what advice might you give them? Sometimes stepping outside our own perspective can reveal new solutions.  \n\nFinally, what do you think would happen if you approached this as a teamwork issue (\"How can we *both* enjoy meals?\") rather than a demand? Could that shift the conversation?  \n\n(Offering space to reflect—no need to answer all at once!)",

The healthier perspective you’re building, one that values readers’ heartfelt responses and your own creative pride, is so much more nurturing and realistic. Try gently reminding yourself of these measures of success when self-doubt creeps in, perhaps by keeping a note of encouraging reader feedback or reflecting on moments of pride in your work. You’re already growing in self-awareness, and that’s something to celebrate. Keep honoring the impact your writing has, both on others and on you.",
